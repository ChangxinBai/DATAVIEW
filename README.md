# DATAVIEW
DATAVIEW (www.dataview.org) is a big data workflow management system. It uses Dropbox as the data cloud and Amazon EC2 as the compute cloud. Current research focuses on the performance and cost optimization for running workflows in clouds.



DATAVIEW supports two programing interfaces to develop and run workflows:

1. <b>JAVA API:</b> A programmer can develop various workflow tasks and workflows based on the DATAVIWE libraries. /DATAVIEW/src/test.java shows the six steps to create a customized workflow and execute it in Amazon EC2.
* The external dependecies libraries must be added to the Eclipse project from /DATAVIEW/WebContent/WEB-INF/lib
* The accessKey and secretKey should be updated in config.properties under /DATAVIEW/WebContent/workflowLibDir/
* After finishing the workflow, please terminate all the EC2 instances from your AWS account manually.

2. <b>Visual Programming</b>: DATAVIEW is deployed as a web site in Tomcat and a user can drag and drop tasks and link them into a workflow in a visual workflow design and execution environment called <b>Webbench</b>. 

* A dropbox accout is necessary to store all the input data and each tasks and the final output file when a workflow execution is finished. The user needs to create some default folders 
Dropbox/DATAVIEW/Tasks which stores the task file (class file or jar file); Dropbox/DATAVIEW/Workflows which stores the mxgraph file for the generated workflow; Dropbox/DATAVIEW-INPUT stores the input files for a workflow. 
* A local account needs to be registered to show a visualized workflow.
* A dropbox token should be provided in the main interface when you login in, which can be generated based on this tutorial:https://blogs.dropbox.com/developers/2014/05/generate-an-access-token-for-your-own-account/
